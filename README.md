### About Me 🚀
- 🌱 I am a Software Developer based in Southern California with a Bachelor's in Computer Science with a Minor in Math. </br>   
- 👨‍💻 I love learning about how to make code reliable, scalable, and maintainable. 
- 👯 I believe that with a permissible team culture, legacy code can be made beautiful. </br>
- 💬 My favorite tech quote is from Edsger W. Dijkstra when he wrote "Simplicity is a prerequisite for reliability"
- 🤔 I’m currently looking for help on developing and growing my [tech meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ucsd-cracking-the-coding-interview/).
   * Experienced Professionals - I would highly appreciate you sharing your experience and how you got to where you are.
   * People New To Tech - I would love your thoughts on how y'all would like us devs to help you.
